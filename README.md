# push_swap

Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

The learning objectives of this project are rigor, use of C, and use of basic algorithms. Especially focusing on their complexity.

<b><p align=center>Sorting values is simple. To sort them the fastest way possible is less simple.</p></b>
